# ML SVM for CKD
Simple Machine Learning SVM algorithm for Chronic Kidney Disease detection.


>## Support Vector Machine (SVM)
##### What is SVM?:
Support vector machines so called as SVM is a supervised learning algorithm which can be used for classification and regression problems as support vector classification (SVC) and support vector regression (SVR). It is used for smaller dataset as it takes too long to process. In this set, we will be focusing on SVC.

##### Ideology:
SVM is based on the idea of fitting a line/hyperplane that best separates the features into different classes with larger margin.

##### Intuition development:
In out case we have a kaggle dataset of chronic kidney disease(both normal and abnormal cases) in which the SVM algorithm classifies them by seprating the data with multi dimentional hyperplane. 


##### Necessary Packages - Windows
  scikit-learn - ```pip install sklearn```
  
  Pandas       - ```pip install pandas```
  
  matplotlib   - ```pip install matplotlib```
