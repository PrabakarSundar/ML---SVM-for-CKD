>## Support Vector Machine (SVM)
#####What is SVM?

  Support vector machines so called as SVM is a supervised learning algorithm which can be used for classification and regression problems as support vector classification (SVC) and support vector regression (SVR). It is used for smaller dataset as it takes too long to process. In this set, we will be focusing on SVC.

#####Ideology

  SVM is based on the idea of fitting a line/hyperplane that best separates the features into different classes with larger margin.
